Models of neural mechanisms for learning and execution of movements

This repository contains two models of the grasping network in macaques involving ventral premotor (PMv) and anterior intraparietal (AIP) areas. The first program, hopfield_PFC.m, is a simple model with the classic Hopfield network dynamics. The second program, learn2grasp.m (which requires pop.m to run), is an effort to translate the ideas of the first program into a more biologically realistic model.
